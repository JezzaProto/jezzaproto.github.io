		<p> First of all, thank you for coming to my site! Its usually quite quiet here... </p>
		<p> <h3> <u> A bit about myself </u> </h3>
		I'm JezzaProto! Just a random guy on the internet that enjoys programming, 3d modelling and other stuff like that.<br>
		</p>
		<p> <h3> <u> What is this site for? </u> </h3>
		Mostly, I'll upload images (and maybe the occasional blender file) of stuff I have modelled.<br>
		Expect to see stuff like that and probably some of my social medias on here soon!
